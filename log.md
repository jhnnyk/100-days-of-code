# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Express basics course on Treehouse. Got to the section on templating with Jade/Pug.

**Thoughts:** Still really enjoying it, but I'm not sure Pug really seems worth it. I mean I guess it's faster to write, but at this point I kind of feel like I'd rather just write plain HTML.

### Day 15: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Express basics course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** Really psyched on it for some reason. Maybe because it seems a bit like Sinatra so I kind of feel like I know what I'm doing. Probably more so because I hear so much about Node and Express it's great to finally be really digging into it.

### Day 14: June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Github basics course on Treehouse. Started peeking at the Express course.

**Thoughts:** Most of the Githup course was review, but as always I picked up a few useful tidbits. Psyched to get into the Express course.

### Day 13: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through most of the Github course.

**Thoughts:** Actually learned a couple really cool features I had not yet taken advantage of -- like using the issue tracker as a ToDoList for yourself. Very cool.

### Day 12: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Achieved a passing grade on the [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper) project. Started next unit by slogging through a fairly easy Treehouse course on Github.

**Thoughts:** Always great to be able to move forward. Excited to learn Express in this next unit!

### Day 11: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the project requirements for the content scraper (Project 6 of Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree).

**Thoughts:** Fairly satisfied to finish this one out. I really feel like this one had quite a few spots that I had to figure out on my own -- and it feels really good to have stepped through that process and make it happen! Thought about going for the 'exceeds' rating, but frankly I'm not super interested in pushing this one further.

### Day 10: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added URL to the CSV file.

**Thoughts:** Busy, busy, busy. Glad I got something done. Sometimes seemingly complex things code up really quickly and seemingly simple things take tons of research and trial and error!

### Day 9: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Successfully write the CSV to its own file.

**Thoughts:** Another day with very little time (my girl's BDay!), but also another day where I read a little Node.js documentation and implemented what I learned correctly. Stoked!

### Day 8: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the JSON to CSV converter to only be called once... and at the correct time!

**Thoughts:** Very little time today so I didn't get to research promises any further. Managed to get my code to work with a counter... feels a little hackish, but not too bad. Most importantly it works. Looking forward to really learning promises soon!

### Day 7: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the JSON to CSV converter working.

**Thoughts:** I made some progress, but definitely struggling with JavaScript Promises. I sort of get it, but I need a tutorial or something so that I fully understand what's happening.

### Day 6: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented a Node module to scrape information from a webpage.

**Thoughts:** I definitely felt a little lost at the start of this project, but it's really cool to see how by just taking little steps I've actually made some pretty decent progress.

### Day 5: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to check if a directory exists and create one.

**Thoughts:** Pretty stoked on something little. I had no clue how to do this, but between SO and the Node docs I got it working. Very satisfying.

### Day 4: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building a simple dynamic site with Node.js via Treehouse Techdegree.

**Thoughts:** Nice to get focused and feel like I'm moving forward again. Actually understood the video lectures which felt good. Excited to start my own project!

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a basic template engine in Node.js!

**Thoughts:** After a long run today, I think I finally got my plan and focus back. Pretty sure I just need to commit to finishing the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Stoked on the little template engine I built via the lessons today.

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through another video on LearnNode.com. Struggled with a Rails lesson on Learn.co.

**Thoughts:** Struggling with direction and focus: Wanting something more thorough, I jumped back into Learn.co, but almost immediately regretted it. Really struggled with a lesson in Rails. It's hard to switch back and forth and I feel like an idiot for doing so. I need to commit to just one program and actually _finish_ it!

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100DaysOfCode! Finished 'Getting Setup' video in LearnNode.com tutorial. Finished the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design unit on beta.freecodecamp.com. Got mongoDB all set up for the LearnNode.com tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Glad to do the fCC exercises, but struggling a little bit with really understanding cubic-bezier curves and keyframe animations in CSS. Definitely some fun effects possible in only CSS. A little frustrated with how incomplete beta.freecodecamp.com is. Stoked to make some progress on LearnNode.com.
