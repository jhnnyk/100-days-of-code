# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 38: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a little in the Udacity React course and a little of Wesbos's Learn Node course.

**Thoughts:** Glad to get something in after getting 5 stitches in my toe earlier today!

### Day 37: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had phone call with Benjy (onboarding mentor at Thinkful). Started Udacity React course.

**Thoughts:** Still working through my options. Leaning heavily towards Thinkful. But also thinking maybe I can also do the Udacity React course simultaneously. Not sure that's wise, but ... must.learn.everything. lol

### Day 36: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through a few more lessons in Wes Bos's Learn Node course.

**Thoughts:** Talked with Mandy about doing the Thinkful program because it would appear to have enough flexibility to work for us. We'll see. Maybe changing my approach yet again! 😆

### Day 35: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for Udacity's React Nanodegree. Worked through a few more lessons in Wes Bos's Learn Node course. Solved the `isPrime` challenge in the learncollective group.

**Thoughts:** Kind of changing my approach to get things done ASAP and get to where I can build a couple apps that I want to build as soon as possible. Planning to continue through Wes Bos's Learn Node course as well as the Udacity React Nanodegree. I really want to add React/Redux to my skillset as I know it does a few things that I really want to do in my apps.

I'm stoked to keep moving forward on sort of a more condensed approach that will hopefully help me move forward more quickly. I also really like the idea of doing two courses simultaniously -- I don't know maybe I'm ADD, but I think half my problem finishing something is just getting bored.

### Day 34: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through a few more lessons in Wes Bos's Learn Node course.

**Thoughts:** Stoked to be back at it and actually learning something I can use right away. (I'm so impatient ;-)

### Day 33: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started back in on Wes Bos's Learn Node course.

**Thoughts:** So I missed a few days with travel and finally getting into Hardrock(!!!), but the stoke remains! I've been coding more than this log shows, but I've decided not to count it to make up for missing so many days. Earlier this week, I finished up all the requirements for Project 7 of the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree. *Except* for the live streaming part of the extra credit portion. Frankly there was some inconsistency on the project requirements as to whether or not that part was even required. I did ~~waste~~ spend a day researching sockets.io.

That said, in the end, I wasn't super stoked on the rest of the Treehouse curriculum at the moment so I wanted to get back to actually building more stuff. So I switched back to Wes Bos's Learn Node course. Pretty stoked on it and really excited to really start building my own apps!

### Day 32: July 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the updated Treehouse course on Express by matching the PUG templates to the HTML design.

**Thoughts:** Still quite stoked. Really wanting more time to focus on this stuff.

### Day 31: July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work through the updated Treehouse course on Express.

**Thoughts:** Forward progress... even just a little everyday helps.

### Day 28: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work through the updated Treehouse course on Express.

**Thoughts:** Missed a few days -- we were cabin camping in Lake City with no internet. Glad to be back at it though... Forward progress... even just a little everyday helps. Really looking forward to having more time for this stuff at some point.

**Link to work:** [Treehouse Flash Cards app](https://github.com/jhnnyk/TH-flashcards)

### Day 27: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A couple quick lessons on middleware before hitting the road.

**Thoughts:** Forward progress... even just a little everyday helps. Really looking forward to having more time for this stuff at some point.

### Day 26: June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the routing section. Learned how to set up redirects and cookies in Express. Did a code wars challenge with some friends on Slack.

**Thoughts:**  Super stoked. Writing stuff and understanding it feels really good. The code wars challenge was especially good for getting my brain some serious exercise again.

### Day 25: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the Treehouse Express Basics course.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to handle a POST request. Wishing I had more time today -- I'm really digging this stuff.

### Day 24: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: At the recommendation of one of the Treehouse instructors I started going through the updated Express Basics course.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 23: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much visible forward progress. Started a new branch to try out some different strategies.

**Thoughts:** Confirmed with one of the Treehouse instructors that the path I was on was _not_ how I wanted to handle the problem. Started going back and re-watching lectures and reading the Express documentation.

### Day 22: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Dynamic content achieved!

**Thoughts:** Well I got it working, but it felt a bit hackish. I need to review a couple lectures (on middleware and debugging) to really be where I want to be.

**Link to work:** [Twitter Interface](https://github.com/jhnnyk/twitter-interface)

### Day 21: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started trying to get the dynamic content with the Twit module.

**Thoughts:** Definitely getting there. Tough getting some quiet time to really work through this part while I'm pretty much on my own with the kids for a week or so. But thankful to keep plugging away at it little by little. I'm really enjoying it.

### Day 20: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished converting the static HTML template to Pug.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 18: June 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the lessons in Unit 7 and started on my Twitter Interface project.

**Thoughts:** Always exciting to finish up a unit's lessons and get into the project. Again starting this project seemed really intimidating at first -- that feeling of having no clue where to start. But once I got going I really started making some progress. Pretty stoked on how far I got and how quickly I got there today.

**Link to work:** [Twitter Interface](https://github.com/jhnnyk/twitter-interface)

### Day 17: June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Express basics course on Treehouse. (Of course they just released an updated one today :-/) Did a workshop on Express middleware.

**Thoughts:** Stoked to make progress. Really looking forward to building my own app next.

**Link to work:** [Express Basics course](https://github.com/jhnnyk/TH-express-basics)

### Day 16: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Express basics course on Treehouse. Got to the section on templating with Jade/Pug.

**Thoughts:** Still really enjoying it, but I'm not sure Pug really seems worth it. I mean I guess it's faster to write, but at this point I kind of feel like I'd rather just write plain HTML.

**Link to work:** [Express Basics course](https://github.com/jhnnyk/TH-express-basics)

### Day 15: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Express basics course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** Really psyched on it for some reason. Maybe because it seems a bit like Sinatra so I kind of feel like I know what I'm doing. Probably more so because I hear so much about Node and Express it's great to finally be really digging into it.

**Link to work:** [Express Basics course](https://github.com/jhnnyk/TH-express-basics)

### Day 14: June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Github basics course on Treehouse. Started peeking at the Express course.

**Thoughts:** Most of the Githup course was review, but as always I picked up a few useful tidbits. Psyched to get into the Express course.

### Day 13: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through most of the Github course.

**Thoughts:** Actually learned a couple really cool features I had not yet taken advantage of -- like using the issue tracker as a ToDoList for yourself. Very cool.

### Day 12: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Achieved a passing grade on the [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper) project. Started next unit by slogging through a fairly easy Treehouse course on Github.

**Thoughts:** Always great to be able to move forward. Excited to learn Express in this next unit!

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 11: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the project requirements for the content scraper (Project 6 of Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree).

**Thoughts:** Fairly satisfied to finish this one out. I really feel like this one had quite a few spots that I had to figure out on my own -- and it feels really good to have stepped through that process and make it happen! Thought about going for the 'exceeds' rating, but frankly I'm not super interested in pushing this one further.

### Day 10: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added URL to the CSV file.

**Thoughts:** Busy, busy, busy. Glad I got something done. Sometimes seemingly complex things code up really quickly and seemingly simple things take tons of research and trial and error!

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 9: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Successfully write the CSV to its own file.

**Thoughts:** Another day with very little time (my girl's BDay!), but also another day where I read a little Node.js documentation and implemented what I learned correctly. Stoked!

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 8: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the JSON to CSV converter to only be called once... and at the correct time!

**Thoughts:** Very little time today so I didn't get to research promises any further. Managed to get my code to work with a counter... feels a little hackish, but not too bad. Most importantly it works. Looking forward to really learning promises soon!

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 7: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got the JSON to CSV converter working.

**Thoughts:** I made some progress, but definitely struggling with JavaScript Promises. I sort of get it, but I need a tutorial or something so that I fully understand what's happening.

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 6: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented a Node module to scrape information from a webpage.

**Thoughts:** I definitely felt a little lost at the start of this project, but it's really cool to see how by just taking little steps I've actually made some pretty decent progress.

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 5: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to check if a directory exists and create one.

**Thoughts:** Pretty stoked on something little. I had no clue how to do this, but between SO and the Node docs I got it working. Very satisfying.

**Link to work:** [Shirts4Mike Content Scraper](https://github.com/jhnnyk/shirts4mike-content-scraper)

### Day 4: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building a simple dynamic site with Node.js via Treehouse Techdegree.

**Thoughts:** Nice to get focused and feel like I'm moving forward again. Actually understood the video lectures which felt good. Excited to start my own project!

**Link to work:** [Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Unit 6](https://github.com/jhnnyk/TH-FSJS-Unit6)

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a basic template engine in Node.js!

**Thoughts:** After a long run today, I think I finally got my plan and focus back. Pretty sure I just need to commit to finishing the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Stoked on the little template engine I built via the lessons today.

**Link to work:** [Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - Unit 6](https://github.com/jhnnyk/TH-FSJS-Unit6)

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through another video on LearnNode.com. Struggled with a Rails lesson on Learn.co.

**Thoughts:** Struggling with direction and focus: Wanting something more thorough, I jumped back into Learn.co, but almost immediately regretted it. Really struggled with a lesson in Rails. It's hard to switch back and forth and I feel like an idiot for doing so. I need to commit to just one program and actually _finish_ it!

**Link to work:** [Flatiron BNB Methods Lab](https://github.com/jhnnyk/flatiron-bnb-methods-cb-000)

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100DaysOfCode! Finished 'Getting Setup' video in LearnNode.com tutorial. Finished the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design unit on beta.freecodecamp.com. Got mongoDB all set up for the LearnNode.com tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Glad to do the fCC exercises, but struggling a little bit with really understanding cubic-bezier curves and keyframe animations in CSS. Definitely some fun effects possible in only CSS. A little frustrated with how incomplete beta.freecodecamp.com is. Stoked to make some progress on LearnNode.com.
