# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100DaysOfCode! Finished 'Getting Setup' video in LearnNode.com tutorial. Finished the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design unit on beta.freecodecamp.com. Got mongoDB all set up for the LearnNode.com tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Glad to do the fCC exercises, but struggling a little bit with really understanding cubic-bezier curves and keyframe animations in CSS. Definitely some fun effects possible in only CSS. A little frustrated with how incomplete beta.freecodecamp.com is. Stoked to make some progress on LearnNode.com.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
