# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building a simple dynamic site with Node.js via Treehouse Techdegree.

**Thoughts:** Nice to get focused and feel like I'm moving forward again. Actually understood the video lectures which felt good. Excited to start my own project!

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a basic template engine in Node.js!

**Thoughts:** After a long run today, I think I finally got my plan and focus back. Pretty sure I just need to commit to finishing the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Stoked on the little template engine I built via the lessons today.

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went through another video on LearnNode.com. Struggled with a Rails lesson on Learn.co.

**Thoughts:** Struggling with direction and focus: Wanting something more thorough, I jumped back into Learn.co, but almost immediately regretted it. Really struggled with a lesson in Rails. It's hard to switch back and forth and I feel like an idiot for doing so. I need to commit to just one program and actually _finish_ it!

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Committed to #100DaysOfCode! Finished 'Getting Setup' video in LearnNode.com tutorial. Finished the Applied Visual Design section of the Responsive Web Design unit on beta.freecodecamp.com. Got mongoDB all set up for the LearnNode.com tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Glad to do the fCC exercises, but struggling a little bit with really understanding cubic-bezier curves and keyframe animations in CSS. Definitely some fun effects possible in only CSS. A little frustrated with how incomplete beta.freecodecamp.com is. Stoked to make some progress on LearnNode.com.
